# Instructions

The game was designed for the ATmega32U2 UC funkit. Holding the funkit with the mini-usb being the top of the board (north facing).
To start the game press the white button the the left hand side of the board. 
The aim of the game is to test your memory ability, similar to Simon Says. With three difficulties **Easy (E)**, **Medium (M)** and **Hard (H)** each will challenge you with different lengths and variations of speed.


Once chosen a difficulty by pushing the black navigation switch in a pattern will be randomly generated. This pattern could be either **Left arrow**, **Right arrow**, **Up arrow**, **Down arrow**, or **Push button**. When the blue LED is illuminated then you must repeat the pattern that was just shown by moving the black navigation switch in the corresponding direction or pushing it in. Failing to replicate the exact pattern will result in the game ending with a score being displayed, otherwise the player will win once the pattern has reached the end.

Further tries can be attempted using the white button on the left hand side of the board.
